            <p class="para">My name is Carlos Eduardo, and I live in the city of Tiangu√°. I have always had an aptitude for technology and communication. At the age of 14, I became highly interested in marketing. After extensive study, I started working as an affiliate on a digital platform for approximately 1.5 years, gaining experience in sales. By the time I was 16, I purchased a Facebook course that piqued my interest. I learned how to run and validate campaigns, and I worked on projects for close friends, where my role was to advertise their stores and retain as many customers as possible. I continued in this field until the end of 2022.

            In July 2023, bombarded by advertisements about how programmers were making a significant amount of money while enjoying the geographic freedom coveted by many, I decided to try my hand at it. I purchased my first Python bootcamp. After some time spent programming in Python, I began to develop my skills in HTML and CSS with the guidance of the well-known Gustavo Guanabara. As I was eager to learn, I completed all of his courses, specifically four courses of 40 hours each in just one month. Afterward, I realized that my skills were still not sufficient, so I also specialized in JavaScript. Today, I am still working on my development and striving to improve every day, taking on projects and acquiring more knowledge.</p>
